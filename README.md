This is a fork of [Nginx Server Configs] (https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx)

This is also heavily inspired from [Awesome Nginx configuration template] (https://github.com/Umkus/nginx-boilerplate)

**Nginx Server Configs** is a collection of configuration snippets that can
help your server improve the web site's performance and security, while also
ensuring that resources are served with the correct content-type and are
accessible, if needed, even cross-domain.
